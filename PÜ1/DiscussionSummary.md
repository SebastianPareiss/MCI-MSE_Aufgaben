## Project background

### Purpose of project

Generating software with the goal to extract EKG monitor data from a bicycle ergometer. The data should be analyzed and visualized on a display. This project should teach us how to work on bigger projects furtherdown our studies. The goal of this project is to increase our programming skills and to show us how to work on in a "programming-team". 

### Scope of project

The project consists of several different tasks. It should teach us how to plan and realize a project in a company. The project starts with the creation of a "Readme" an a "Discussion Summary". After that there will be lots of different other tasks to work on. The priority is to write your first own software.

### Other background information

This project has been developed for educational purposes at the MCI Innsbruck.

## Perspectives
### Who will use the system?

The main use of the system is for learning purposes in the course of the lecture. But the program can ultimately be used in real life to diagnose performance. In the case of our task, the software is created for a company that already has a working ergometer. It is used by this company to test patients and analyse their EKG-values.

### Who can provide input about the system?

Input can be provided by the students who works on the project. Also the lecturers provide input by creating new tasks and new ideas which are teached in lesson. If there are further question a lecturer who has experience with equiptment like a bicycle ergometer can support the team by giving input.


## Project Objectives
### Known business rules

...

### System information and/or diagrams

Beispiel von aufgezeichneten EKG Daten
![](ekg_example.png)

Aus diesem muss die Herzrate bestimmt werden.

### Assumptions and dependencies

EKG example.png are assumed to be correct within a resonable margin of error. The hardware must work as planned so the software can use the provided data. The whole analyzing process depends on the functionality of the programmed software.

### Design and implementation constraints

The hardware of the bicycle ergometer is limited, for example the number of displays to show data.

## Risks

Possible sources of error might be the data gathering process. Also the analysing and visualisation of the measurements could lead to errors. The hardware must also work, otherwise the software cannot be used properly.

## Known future enhancements

Not as of now
