## Project background

### Purpose of project

Generating software with the goal to extract EKG monitor data, to analyse it and visual display it.
The project should teach us how to work on a biger project. During this project our proframming skills are increased. 

### Scope of project

The project consists of several different task. 

### Other background information

This project has been developed for educational purposes at the MCI Innsbruck.

## Perspectives
### Who will use the system?

The main use of the system is for learning purposes in the course of the lecture. 
But the program can ultimately be used in real life to diagnose performance


### Who can provide input about the system?

...


## Project Objectives
### Known business rules

...

### System information and/or diagrams

Beispiel von aufgezeichneten EKG Daten
![](ekg_example.png)

Aus diesem muss die Herzrate bestimmt werden.

### Assumptions and dependencies

EKG example.png are assumed to be correct within a resonable margin of error                  

### Design and implementation constraints

hardware constrains (number of displays)
incase this software ever will be used in any professionell capacity the developers take no responsibility

## Risks

Possible sources of error might be errors in the data gathering process as well as analysing or visualisation errors

## Known future enhancements

not as of now
